The Prject is based on the key Idea of the ride sharing platforms having three kind of users namely "Traveler" , "Traveler Companion" and "Admin". <br>
Whrere each of them has different set of functionalities: <br>
"Traveler" ==> <br>
-> Can create a trip <br>
-> Can update his current location (If Traveler is within 1km range of the destination a  notification will be sent to his companions) <br>
-> Can view all his rides ongoing as well as completed  <br>
--> Can give Feedback for his past or ongoing trip <br>
--> Can retrieve the notifications <br>
<br><br><br>
"Travel Companion"==> <br>
--> Can view the ongoing trip for a Traveler if he is a valid companion for that Trip <br>
--> Can add a feedback to the trip for which he is a valid companion <br>
--> Can retrieve the noftifications <br>
<br><br><br>
"Admin"==> <br>
--> Can view all the ride details of a particular person <br>
--> Can view all the feedbacks given by a particular user <br>
--> Can retrieve all the Rides ongoinCompleted till now <br>
--> Can retrive all the feedbacks given  <br>
