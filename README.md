The Prject is based on the key Idea of the ride sharing platforms having three kind of users namely "Traveler" , "Traveler Companion" and "Admin".
Whrere each of them has different set of functionalities:
"Traveler" ==>
-> Can create a trip
-> Can update his current location (If Traveler is within 1km range of the destination a notification will be sent to his companions)
-> Can view all his rides ongoing as well as completed
--> Can give Feedback for his past or ongoing trip
--> Can retrieve the notifications

"Travel Companion"==>
--> Can view the ongoing trip for a Traveler if he is a valid companion for that Trip
--> Can add a feedback to the trip for which he is a valid companion
--> Can retrieve the noftifications

"Admin"==>
--> Can view all the ride details of a particular person
--> Can view all the feedbacks given by a particular user
--> Can retrieve all the Rides ongoinCompleted till now
--> Can retrive all the feedbacks given 

** Note : Used ThunderCLient to run all the API's
